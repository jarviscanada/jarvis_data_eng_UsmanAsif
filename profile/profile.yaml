# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am detail-oriented, and an inquisitive problem solver who loves to build simple solutions for complex real-world problems. Throughout my education (bachelor’s in electrical engineering and master’s in engineering) I have developed a true passion for code. I believe that data engineering is the most relevant area within IT in the 21st century. As an Applications and  Data Engineer, I learnt tools and skills including but not limited to software design patterns, core Java programming, version control, building microservices, testing, and deployment. Collaborating within and across teams to address challenges at the organizational or personal level helps me foster a productive work environment overall. I am a quick learner who adapts to fast-paced work environments.One of my greatest drives to work in the software industry is the positive impact technology can have on a large scale for the social good. My passion lies in leveraging the power of data and cutting-edge technology to improve people's lives on a day-to-day basis.
